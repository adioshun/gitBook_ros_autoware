# How to train your team with ROS self-driving cars

- Webinar, 2017.11.2 Ricardo Tellez
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAXUfQUUH2c)

## 1. Why ROS for Autonomous Cars

- Existing code : 많은 부분이 코드화 되어 있음 
    - Map building
    - Localization with LiDARS or GPS
    - Path Planing
    - Obstacle Avoidance
    - Process Sensor Data


- Visualization Tools
    - Rviz with Autoware

        
- Hardware
    - Dataspeed Inc회사 : ROS기반 ADAS Development Vehicle Kit 판매 
    
## 2. Week points of ROS

- Single point of failure : One core Process 기반, 하나의 프로세스가 죽으면 나머지도 영향을 받음 

- Not Secure : eg. 암호화 툴이 없음 

- Not Certified :

### 3.1 Learn ROS

### 3.2 Learn ROS Navigation 

- SLAM

- Path Planing

- etc. 

### 3.3 Learn Basic ROS for Autonomous cars

- CAN Bus 

- etc. 

### 3.4 Build a reduced version with real robots to solve real problems

- http://duckietown.mit.edu/ (The Duckietown experience at MIT has concluded in 2016.)

- etc. 

### 3.5 Practice with Autoware ROSbags of real life conditions. 


### 3.6 Practice in more complex environmnets with Gazebo sims
